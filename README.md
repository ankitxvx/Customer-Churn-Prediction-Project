## Overview

Customer churn prediction is an essential task for businesses to understand and mitigate customer attrition. This project builds a predictive model using synthetic data to forecast whether a customer is likely to churn based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset (`customer_churn_data_large.csv`) consists of synthetic customer records generated for this project. It includes features such as CustomerID, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, and the target variable Churn.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

Install them using `pip` with the command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- `generate_customer_churn_data.py`: Python script to generate synthetic customer churn data.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Module for data loading and preprocessing.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Module for feature engineering tasks.
- `model_training.py`: Module for model training, including hyperparameter tuning.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Module for evaluating model performance.
- `main.py`: Main script to orchestrate the entire pipeline.

## Usage

1. **Generate Dataset**:
   ```sh
   python generate_customer_churn_data.py
   ```

2. **Run Main Script**:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

This will execute the entire pipeline: loading data, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
